## [Unreleased]

### Added — Phase 1 (in progress): secure platform core

- Storage (`packages/storage`, ADR 0007): `node:sqlite` port with hardened connection
  settings and owner-only files; atomic, checksummed schema migrations; AES-256-GCM
  secret records bound to their kind and id; master key from a file or environment
  variable that fails closed when missing or wrong and is never generated implicitly;
  verified master key rotation; verified online backups, backup verification and
  validated offline restore; automatic pre-migration backups.
- Operator manual: `docs/configuration.md` (data directory, master key) and
  `docs/backup-restore.md`.

### Added — Phase 0: research and contract baseline

- Repository skeleton: npm workspaces (14 private packages), strict TypeScript 6, ESLint,
  Prettier, Vitest; pinned toolchain on Node.js 26 LTS.
- API contract baseline for UniFi Network 11.0.97 (73 operations), Protect 7.3.74 (74) and
  Access API reference 2026-03-23 (107), with provenance, checksums and local base URLs.
- API tooling: `api:fetch-specs` (checksum-verified download), `api:reconcile` (drift
  detection), `api:coverage-report` (coverage matrix).
- ADRs 0001–0006, threat-model notes, phase plan and checklist.
- Contract tests for the MCP TypeScript SDK v2 (2025-era and 2026-07-28 clients) and for
  the API inventory invariants.
